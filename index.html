						This is how I work. Lots of others also work remotely.
						Perfect as it means I can live where I want and be fairly flexible about hours -
						I live in Scotland, in the winter it stays dark till late in the morning and gets dark super early.
						Being able to get out for a run in the middle of the day is super important to me.
						Have also worked from other places, a coworking space in Germany, an apartment in Chamonix.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section><h2>Challenges</h2></section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Not missing out on things happening in the office. Both social and work related.
						No 'water cooler' conversations.
						Still feeling like part of the team.
						It's easier the more remote people there are on the team.

						At Tes we have a system of "Champions" where one person takes responsibility for a specific aspect of life at Tes.
						Then we rotate after a few months. We've just started doing this, and my first Champion role was the Champion of remote happiness.
						Aim is to address any challenges within this area & for the first time of having the role wanted to define some guidelines.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Meeting guidelines</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Use the snowball microphones if there is more than one person around a computer</li>
							<ul><li>Each team should have (or be getting) one</li></ul>
						<li>Check that all participants can hear</li>
							<ul><li>If you can’t hear, check your speaker volume is turned up. If it is and you still can’t hear, let everyone else in the meeting know!</li></ul>
						<li>Go on mute if you’re not speaking</li>
							<ul><li>Especially if you’re in a noisy office. If that’s causing a problem, consider moving somewhere quieter and / or ordering a better headset from Service Now</li></ul>
						<li>Try to put a camera on the speaker</li>
							<ul><li>Zoom allows screensharing and video at the same time</li></ul>
						<li>In a large group Q & A, always repeat the question</li>
							<ul><li>Chances are not everyone heard the first time</li></ul>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Have shared this with other parts of Tes, eg. HR if they want to run remote meetings -
						it's only really the engineering team who are remote.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Tools</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Hipchat</li>
						<li>Zoom</li>
						<li>Floobits</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Not just zoom, often try other video clients. Record all meetings so they can be watched on youtube.
						Eg. weekly knowledge shares.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<a href="http://employees-map.dokku.management.tescloud.com/">Map of all the Tes engineers</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Wanted to make it easier to visualise who all the engineers are and where we are
						Hack day project, still WIP. Available only on Tes wifi or our vpn (we don't want to give away info on when someone may be away from home!)
						Uses timezone.io to show who is in which timezone. Useful for meetings etc & checking when someone may be online.
						Leaflet.js for the mapping
						Reads from a json api that contains data about who everyone is and their lat/lng
						Can be updated from hipchat - LIVE EXAMPLE
						One of the awesome things about this  was that it was a hackday project across the last 2 hackdays & had people from 4 different timezone working on it
						Great because you can finish up for the evening and then someone in the US can pick up where you left off! (in theory...)
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section><h2>What next?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						We're still all pretty new to this and all still learning.
						With the map want to make it more useful, e.g. use hipchat to find out where people are
						Continue trying to make it easier to work remotely at Tes.
						Particularly want to think about how to include remote people in social events.
						This week is great as everyone is here, but that isn't usual.
						Gitlabs (all remote) have remote coffee breaks. We haven't tried this yet.
						Any suggestions would be most welcome!
